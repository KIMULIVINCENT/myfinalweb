                                            Like every other business, the watch world got the hots for sustainability recently, with mixed results. Oris, whose watches already offered some of the best value for money in the entire luxury timepiece market, has been ahead of that curve for years, supporting various 	ethical practises on land and sea.It announced that by the end of 2021 it will be "climate neutral" – not just its factory but its boutiques, watches, the whole shebang, having zero negative impact. <br> To mark this not-inconsiderable achievement it has released a limited-edition version of its Big Crown ProPilot honouring the 10th anniversary of Botswana’s aeromedical rescue organisation Okavango Air Rescue. Appropriately, it was inspired by nature.Also appropriately, it’s green. <br> £1,1950; mrporter.com

                                        	Tag Heuer’s Aquaracer Professional 300 series got a reboot earlier this year. It was more evolution than revolution – tweaks that improved an already hugely-popular watch (date window now at... 6 o’clock!) – but that didn't mean it wasn't all the better for it.Joining the eight models comes the Nightdiver with its all-black appearance and its unmissable lume dial. Available in three versions, the DLC-coated model in black ceramic is our pick – a heavy-duty badass remix of a much-loved watch.

                                         Celebrating its 40th anniversary a few too many years early, Swatch has released a whole line-up of watches centred around its birth year, 1984. For this it has worked with a new material called Bioceramic, a tough-but-smooth-to-the-touch substance that is two-thirds ceramic, one-third bio-sourced plastic. The watches come in a total of 18 styles, sizes and colours. All with decade-appropriate designs.

                                        	Ask a watchy type for a solid, revered all-rounder, and they'll probably say a Tudor Black Bay. First launched mid-2012, Tudor's signature piece has quickly ascended the ranks to become an entry-level grail of sorts. And, with the introduction of a brand new chronograph, there's now a piece that's eerily similar to a 'Paul Newman' Rolex Daytona.
                                        	Both brands enjoy a close working relationship, so it's all above board. The upside with Tudor however, is that it's a lot more affordable
